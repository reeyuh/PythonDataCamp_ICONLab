    "## Overview\n",
    "> Classes serve as a natural extention of the utility of functions and Python objects by packaging these into groups of related properties and actions. Further, these groups of properties and actions can be easily be inherited by other Classes. We were introduced to the native/built-in/primitive Python objects in previous lessons. Here we can think of a Class a standard way of leveraging Python's object-oriented methods toward building new objects. The Class defines the template for the Class. (Think how a list object is a blueprint for combining other Python objects that of mixed type!)\n",
    ">\n",
    "> In this week's lesson, we will create our first simple classes. We will see how Classes serve as templates for creating instances that can vary by pre-defined properties and actions. We will then see how inheritance works how this supports can support the various packages the Python community develops. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Classes\n",
    "> We will look at:\n",
    "> - Defining classes using methods and attributes\n",
    "> - Setting the initial state of class instances\n",
    "> - Understand how inheritance works to build class hierarchies\n",
    "> - Create a simple package containing a class hierarchy as a group (using Git)"
